# Sticky session

A simple performant way to use [socket.io](http://socket.io/) with a
[cluster](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/cluster.html).

## Installation

```bash
npm install sticky-session
```

## Usage

```javascript
var sticky = require('sticky-session');

var server = require('http').createServer(function(req, res) {
  res.end('worker: ' + process.env.NODE_WORKER_ID);
});

if (sticky.listen(server, 3000)) {
  // Master code
  server.once('listening', function() {
    console.log('server started on 3000 port');
  });
} else {
  // Worker code
}
```
Simple

## Reasoning

Socket.io is doing multiple requests to perform handshake and establish
connection with a client. With a `cluster` those requests may arrive to
different workers, which will break handshake protocol.

Sticky-sessions module is balancing requests using their IP address. Thus
client will always connect to same worker server, and socket.io will work as
expected, but on multiple processes!

#### Note about `node` version

`sticky-session` requires `node` to be at least `0.12.0` because it relies on
`net.createServer`'s [`pauseOnConnect` flag](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#
net_net_createserver_options_connectionlistener).

A deeper, step-by-step explanation on how this works can be found in
