# Sticky session

A simple performant way to use [socket.io][0] with a [cluster][1].

## Installation

```bash
npm install sticky-session
```

## Usage

```javascript
var cluster = require('cluster'); // Only required if you want the worker id
var sticky = require('sticky-session');

var server = require('http').createServer(function(req, res) {
  res.end('worker: ' + cluster.worker.id);
});

var options = {env:{"foo":"Some Environment Variables (optional)"}};

if (!sticky.listen(server, 3000, options)) {
  // Master code
  server.once('listening', function() {
    console.log('server started on 3000 port');
  });
} else {
  // Worker code
}
```
Simple

## Options
The options object is optional and can be passed in as a third parameter to sticky.listen.
### env
Object: An object containing key/value environment variables that each worker will receive.
### host
String: A string value that the server will bind to as its host.
### workers
Integer: The number of workers to bring up. Defaults to the number of available cores.
### returnInstance
Boolean: Affects what is returned by the sticky.listen function. Defaults to `false`.
When false: return `false` for tha master cluster process, and `true` to workers.
When true: return the server instance to the master cluster process, and `false` to workers.
```
var serverInstance = sticky.listen(server, 3000, {returnInstance: true});
if(serverInstance !== false){
    //Master code
    server.once('listening', function() {
        var address = serverInstance.address();
        console.log("Server listening on " + address.address + ":" + address.port");
    });
} else {
    //Worker code
}
```
## Reasoning

Socket.io is doing multiple requests to perform handshake and establish
connection with a client. With a `cluster` those requests may arrive to
different workers, which will break handshake protocol.

Sticky-sessions module is balancing requests using their IP address. Thus
client will always connect to same worker server, and socket.io will work as
expected, but on multiple processes!

#### Note about `node` version

`sticky-session` requires `node` to be at least `0.12.0` because it relies on
`net.createServer`'s [`pauseOnConnect` flag][2].

A deeper, step-by-step explanation on how this works can be found in
[`elad/node-cluster-socket.io`][3]
